## ipsurge hosted service

> [`soon..`](http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Soon_15db89_2831712.jpg)

We are planning to have a ipsurge hosted service that you could use directly, so that you don't have to configure your own IPFS node, and simple do `ipsurge publish --remote` to get your application hosted (with the possibility of having your own domain). Still under development, but if this idea sounds interesting, let us know on IRC freenode #IPFS channel or on the issues of this project!
