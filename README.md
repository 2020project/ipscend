## How to get an IPFS node running in your local machine

There are two best ways to run a IPFS node in your personal computer:

- [Using the IPFS application based on electron](https://github.com/ipfs/electron-app)
- [Installing the go-ipfs node in your machine](http://ipfs.io/docs/install)

## Use IPFS to host your webpage using a standard domain (includes cool DNS trick!)

If you are looking into having your application accesible through `youdomain.com`, instead of referencing it by a `/ipfs/hash`, we have a solution for you.

Every IPFS node HTTP interface checks the host header when it receives a request from a browser, then it performs a DNS lookup for a TXT Record, looking if there is any MerkleLink available, if there is, it will perform the lookup, cache that path and serve it as if it was a static webserver.

To make this work, simply:

- 1. Publish your application using `ipsurge publish`
- 2. Save the hash returned
- 3. Pick one of the public IPFS nodes IP addresses
```
$ dig +short ipfs.io
178.62.61.185
178.62.158.247
104.236.76.40
104.236.151.122
104.236.176.52
104.236.179.241
128.199.219.111
162.243.248.213
```
- 4. Go into your DNS provider and add a A record of yourdomain.com pointing to ipfs.io and a TXT record with dnslink=<hash returned in step 2>
- 4. Wait a little bit for DNS to propagate
- 5. open yourdomain.com and see that your page was loaded! 

Voil√°, your page is now cached and being served by IPFS

note: you can also host your own IPFS nodes and use the same DNS trick.
