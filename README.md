> Quick and simple deploy tool to host Native Web Applications and Static Web Pages in IPFS

## Usage

Install via npm

```
$ npm install ipscend --global
```

Run the CLI to show the available commands

```
$ ipscend
Usage: ipscend COMMAND [OPTIONS]

Available commands:

browse      Open your application in a browser
init        Initialize a ipscend project
preview     Preview your application before you publish it
publish     Publish your project
screenshot  View or generate screenshots for your application
versions    Check each version published
```

### commands

#### `ipscend browse`

Opens the last published version of your application in the browser.

#### `ipscend init`

Initializes your project. Asks for the folder where the web application will be available and stores an `ipscend.json` object in your current path to store all the metadata it generates, such as published versions and taken screenshots.

#### `ipscend preview`

Serves your application on a local static file server, so that you can try it out before you feel ready to publish it.

#### `ipscend publish`

Publishes the current state of your application to IPFS and stores a reference to it.

**Note:** You have to have a local IPFS node running in order to publish, check below for how to get your local IPFS node running.

#### `ipscend screenshot`

Opens a screenshot preview of all the published versions of your app. In order to generate the screenshots, you must first run `ipscend screenshot --gen`.

#### `ipscend versions`

Prints out the published versions for the app and its respective timestamp.

**Note:** In order to use this feature, you must set `API_ORIGIN=*` as an environment variable before running your IPFS node.

## How to get an IPFS node running in your local machine

There are two best ways to run an IPFS node on your personal computer:

- [Using the IPFS application based on electron](https://github.com/ipfs/electron-app)
- [Installing the go-ipfs node in your machine](http://ipfs.io/docs/install)

## Use IPFS to host your webpage using a standard domain (includes cool DNS trick!)

If you are looking into having your application accesible through `youdomain.com`, instead of referencing it by a `/ipfs/hash`, we have a solution for you.

Every IPFS node HTTP interface checks the host header when it receives a request from a browser, then it performs a DNS lookup for a TXT Record, looks if there is any MerkleLink available, and, if there is, it performs a lookup, caching that path and serving it as if it was a static webserver.

To make this work, simply:

- 1. Publish your application using `ipscend publish`.
- 2. Save the returned hash.
- 3. Pick one of the public IPFS nodes IP addresses.
```sh
$ dig +short ipfs.io
178.62.61.185
178.62.158.247
104.236.76.40
104.236.151.122
104.236.176.52
104.236.179.241
128.199.219.111
162.243.248.213
```
- 4. Go into your DNS provider and add an A record for each of the ipfs.io IPs available to `yourdomain.com` (just one would do fine as well) and a TXT record with `dnslink=<hash returned in step 2>`.
- 4. Wait a little bit for DNS to propagate.
- 5. Open yourdomain.com and see that your page was loaded!

Voil√°, your page is now cached and is being served by IPFS.

**Note: You can also host your own IPFS nodes and use the same DNS trick.**
